# Fixed File Format converter

Generic tool to convert fixed file format files to a csv file based on a metadata file describing its structure.

## Use case

Fixed file format files can have any number of columns
A column can be of 3 formats:
* date (format yyyy-mm-dd)
* numeric (decimal separator '.' ; no thousands separator ; can be negative)
* string

The structure of the file is described in a metadata file in csv format with a line for each column defining:
* column name
* column length
* column type

File should be transformed as a csv file (separator ',' and row separator CRLF)

The dates have to be reformatted to dd/mm/yyyy

The trailing spaces of string columns must be trimmed

The csv file must include a first line with the columns names

## Example

Data file:
```
1970-01-01John           Smith           81.5
1975-01-31Jane           Doe             61.1
1988-11-28Bob            Big            102.4
```

Metadata file:
```
Birth date,10,date
First name,15,string
Last name,15,string
Weight,5,numeric
```

Output file:
```
Birth date,First name,Last name,Weight
01/01/1970,John,Smith,81.5
31/01/1975,Jane,Doe,61.1
28/11/1988,Bob,Big,102.4
```

## Extra requirements
* files are encoded in UTF-8 and may contain special characters
* strings columns may contain separator characters like ',' and then the whole string needs to be escaped with " (double quotes). Only CR or LF are forbidden
* in case the format of the file is not correct, the program should fail but say explicitly why
* a fixed format file may be very big (several GB)


## Solution

###### FileConverterUtil is utility which can help to parse fixed width file to csv. [univocity-parse](https://www.univocity.com/pages/univocity_parsers_documentation) is the java-api which is being used for parsing the file.

**To execute this demo, following three inputs are required as VM arguments:**
* Metadata File Path – VM argument can be passed using -Dmetadata
* Input File Path – VM argument can be passed using -Dinput
* Output File Path – VM argument can be passed using -Doutput

To parse Fixed with File, following code snippet can be used.
```
FileProcessor fileProcessor = new FileProcessor(metadataFile);
fileProcessor.parseFixedWidthFile(inputFile, outputFile);
```

In above sample code, metadata, inputFile and outputFile are variables which contains path of the input files which should be passed to process the file.

Sample demo class “ParsingFixedWidthFileDemo” is available which is showing how to use this utility.

User Exception handling + Unit test case coverage can be improved.
